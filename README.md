# Crosschain Bridge Simulation Engine

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how blockchain bridge systems can be modeled using clean and modular Web3 architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating cross-chain token transfers, validating bridge states, tracking transaction flow, and generating analytics in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.
